* This is a presentation totally based on [Kevin Markham's tutorial on dplyr](http://www.dataschool.io/dplyr-tutorial-for-faster-data-manipulation-in-r/). I've made a few tweaks and dropped/added few things based on my need. 

* Kevin also has created a [40-minute video tutorial](http://youtu.be/jWjqLW-u3hc) introducing Hadley Wickham's excellent [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) package, and posted the walk-through document used in the video [on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial).
